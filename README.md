# ShingleLink™

**Wires Not Included™**  
The world’s first truly wire-free, modular smart roofing system — powered by the sun, snap-fit by design, and scalable from Earth to orbit.

## Overview

ShingleLink™ is a modular solar roofing platform that installs like shingles, connects via contact pads, and routes all wiring through a drop-in ridge spine. It needs no tools, no wires between panels, and no electrician. Just nail it in, click it together, and route the output from the inside.

## Core Innovations

- 🔌 **Zero Roof Wiring** – No cables between shingles, modules, or ridge caps
- ⚡ **Snap-In Contact Pads** – Align, press, power — like USB for rooftops
- 🧠 **Smart Spine™ Ridge Cap** – Houses MPPTs, lithium batteries, and output terminals
- 💨 **Wind Tunnel Cooling** – Ridge cap includes push/pull fan system with snap-on accessories
- 🔗 **Modular End Caps** – Add flood lights, cameras, sensors, or wireless relays — powered by BBPS
- 🧱 **Interior Power Terminal** – 4 AWG screw terminals accessible from attic or interior wall
- 🛠️ **DIY-Ready Kits** – No training required. If you can roof, you can solar.

## Wires Not Included™

Because they aren’t needed anymore.

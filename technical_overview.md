# ShingleLink Technical Overview

## Contact Pad-Based Shingles

Each smart shingle connects via overlapping conductive pads, auto-aligning and forming a weather-sealed parallel circuit. No roof-face wiring. Pre-drilled center holes allow mounting screws to serve as both fasteners and pressure terminals.

## Smart Spine™ Ridge Cap

The modular Smart Spine system clicks into aligned rows of shingles using matching lips and contact pads. Each ridge unit contains:

- MPPT controllers
- Optional lithium battery pack
- Modular bus bar system
- Forced-air cooling via end fans (push/pull tunnel)
- Snap-in accessories via exposed end cap

## End-Cap Accessories

Each ridge cap ends in a Smart Lip with exposed pads, vents, and mount flange. Snap-on modules include:

- Filter covers (standard)
- Flood lights
- Cameras
- Wireless repeaters
- Fan boosters

## Power Output

A heavy-duty terminal block on the **bottom interior side** (4 AWG rated) lets you connect to a battery or inverter **from inside** the home — no penetrations, no exterior cable.

## BBPS Integration

All power rails and smart accessories are BBPS-compliant — ensuring modular DC distribution and maximum efficiency.
